                                                           # _Romance Dawn_
## Problem:
Whoops. It seems Luffy played with my picture and I'm not able to open it anymore. Please help me.

## Solution:
We are given a png file but that file conatins some errors. We run a test on the file using pngcheck 

    root@kali:~/CTF/Sharky CTF# pngcheck -v 7uffy.png 
       File: 7uffy.png (27352 bytes)
        chunk IHDR at offset 0x0000c, length 13
        1113 x 885 image, 32-bit RGB+alpha, non-interlaced
     chunk bKGD at offset 0x00025, length 6
       red = 0x0000, green = 0x0000, blue = 0x0000
    chunk pHYs at offset 0x00037, length 9: 2835x2835 pixels/meter (72 dpi)
    chunk tIME at offset 0x0004c, length 7: 26 Mar 2020 00:45:09 UTC
    chunk iTXt at offset 0x0005f, length 29, keyword: Comment
      uncompressed, no language tag
      no translated keyword, 18 bytes of UTF-8 text
    chunk EASY at offset 0x00088, length 8192:  illegal (unless recently approved) unknown, public chunk
  ERRORS DETECTED in 7uffy.png

We find that their are some illegal chunks "EASY" in the file and "IDAT" chunck is missing. by looking at other png files we find the value
of IDAT chunck. So we change the values of the chunk but we still get no result.
After some google search we find that their can be multipe chunks of IDAT present in the file so we look for more chunks of EASY and hurray 
we find some more chunks of ESAY no we replace them all with the IDAT chunk using ghex editor.
hurray we found the flag.
